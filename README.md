Absolutely! Here's a clear and concise **Flutter Setup Guide for macOS (ARM64 / M1/M2/M3)** — perfect for your GitHub README.

---

## 🛠️ Flutter Installation Guide (macOS ARM64)

### ✅ Prerequisites

* macOS 11 or later (Apple Silicon or Intel)
* Terminal access
* Git (pre-installed)
* Xcode (for iOS)
* Android Studio (for Android)

---

### 📦 Step 1: Download Flutter SDK

Download the Flutter SDK from the [official Flutter website](https://flutter.dev/docs/get-started/install/macos).

---

### 📁 Step 2: Move and Organize

1. Create a directory to store Flutter SDK:

   ```bash
   mkdir ~/developers
   ```

2. If you extracted the Flutter SDK already and it’s in Downloads:

   ```bash
   mv ~/Downloads/flutter ~/developers/
   ```

> If you accidentally unzipped the **contents** of the ZIP directly into `~/developers`, you’ll find `bin/`, `docs/`, etc. directly under `~/developers` — that's also okay.

---

### 🛤️ Step 3: Add Flutter to PATH

Edit your `.zshrc` file:

```bash
sudo nano ~/.zshrc
```

Add this at the bottom (update the path if needed):

```bash
export PATH="$PATH:$HOME/developers/bin"
```

> If Flutter is in `~/developers/flutter/bin`, use that instead:

```bash
export PATH="$PATH:$HOME/developers/flutter/bin"
```

Save and apply:

```bash
source ~/.zshrc
```

---

### 🧪 Step 4: Verify Installation

Run:

```bash
flutter doctor
```

You should see Flutter detected and any missing components listed.

---

### ⚙️ Step 5: Install Dependencies

#### 🔧 Android Studio (for Android development)

* Download from: [https://developer.android.com/studio](https://developer.android.com/studio)
* On first launch, install:

  * Android SDK
  * Android Emulator
  * SDK Platform Tools

#### 🍏 Xcode (for iOS/macOS development)

```bash
xcode-select --install
```

Install full Xcode from App Store and run:

```bash
sudo xcode-select --switch /Applications/Xcode.app/Contents/Developer
sudo xcodebuild -runFirstLaunch
```

#### 📦 CocoaPods (for iOS plugin support)

```bash
sudo gem install cocoapods
```

---

### ✅ Final Check

After installing everything, run:

```bash
flutter doctor
```

All checks should show ✅ green.
